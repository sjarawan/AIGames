The file /pong-game/pong-game/sounds/bounce.wav is intended to be a sound file. Since I cannot generate binary files or audio content directly, this file is intentionally left blank. You will need to create or obtain a suitable WAV file for the bounce sound effect and place it in the specified directory.
